\section{Conclusions}
\label{conclusions}
Even for novice computer users, the need for basic programming skills is increasing. To meet this need, synthesis tools must be able to produce code that is not only correct, but also useful to the users of these tools.

Program synthesis is powerful, but as long as this power is obfuscated level upon level of folds, filters, and maps, most users will not be able to take full advantage of this field. 

Program synthesis has been able to make correct functions, now it is time for it to make an impact.
