\subsection{Limitations}

Without subexample generation we cannot recursively apply our algorithm to create programs with multiple applications of higher order functions as in the   $\Lambda^2$ paper\cite{isil}. Since they provide hard coded subexample generation hypotheses for the higher order functions they use, this does not scale.
