Things to be done as soon as possible

commands like \ruzica, \mark, \alex so that we can write comments
create a file containing the latex shortcuts and command
start to use something useful - it feels like people who use dropbox for repository
stop using colors like some loser hipsters - use listing like real men
Example, if you don't know how to use it:
 
 \lstset{

language=Java,

basicstyle=\small\sffamily,

showspaces=false,

showstringspaces=false,

showtabs=false,

frame=none,

tabsize=2,

captionpos=b,

breaklines=true,

breakatwhitespace=true,

breakautoindent=true,

escapeinside={\%*}{*)},

linewidth=0.5\textwidth

}

Or just go and work as baristas somewhere and wear suspenders
