(1) We use refinement type based inductive generalization (inductively deriving properties from examples).

(2) from the higher order examples we use deductive reasoning to automate refinement type inference on higher order function.

(3) We combine these two with abductive reasoning to create a ranking and perform a best-first enumerative search based on type closeness and code locality.
